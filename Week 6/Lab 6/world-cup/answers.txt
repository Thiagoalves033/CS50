Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Within 10 simulations, for instance, France had 30% chance of winning. It has been proven incorrect since, with the increase of simulations, France has been proven to have around 8% chance of winning. This kind of results also appeared in other teams.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100.000 simulations are sufficient, since it achieves very similar results as the 1.000.000 simulations in a shorter period of time.
