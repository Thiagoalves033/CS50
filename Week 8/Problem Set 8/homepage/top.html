                "The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online.
                Since its inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others in
                learning enough programming to work on their own personal projects.
                <br><br>
                Erik Trautman founded The Odin Project in 2013. Currently it is maintained and continually improved by a team of
                volunteers, many of whom learned to code with us. Many find success from Odin Project's curriculum because of its
                hands-on approach with learning and emphasis on building projects. The curriculum is meticulously curated to ensure the content is up-to-date."
