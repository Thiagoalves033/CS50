TODO 1: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Yellow. As described by Spotify, there's a energy balance that fuels their need.

TODO 2: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
There's more to music than danceability, energy and valence. More values are needed in order to precisely calculate the listener's "Audio Aura"
